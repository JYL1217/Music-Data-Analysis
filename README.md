# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

This project aims to predict the popularity of Spotify songs in 2024 based on various features such as streaming counts, playlist reach, and social media engagement. A `RandomForestRegressor` model is used to predict the target variable, which is the 'Spotify Popularity' feature.

## Overview

This repository contains code that processes Spotify song data, builds a machine learning model to predict song popularity, and evaluates the model's performance.

The key tasks include:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and encoding
3. Model training using `RandomForestRegressor`
4. Model evaluation using multiple metrics
5. Visualization of predictions

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

`pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn`

## Data Preprocessing
The data is loaded from a CSV file, and several preprocessing steps are performed:

1. Handling Missing Values:
Columns with over 50% missing values are dropped.
Rows with missing 'Spotify Popularity' values are also removed.
2. Feature Encoding:
Categorical features (like 'Artist') are encoded using LabelEncoder to make them suitable for machine learning models.
3. Data Cleaning:
Comma characters in object-type columns are removed.
The remaining columns are converted to numeric values.

## Results Visualization
The predictions are visualized using a scatter plot, comparing the true values vs. predicted values. A red 45-degree line is plotted to show perfect predictions.

Fig1. Artist vs Spotify Playlist Reach by Albums

The first scatter plot visualizes the relationship between artists and their respective Spotify Playlist Reach, with each point colored according to the album name. The y-axis represents the playlist reach, indicating how many unique Spotify users could be exposed to a given song through curated playlists.

Fig2. Artist vs Spotify Popularity by Albums
![Artist vs Spotify Popularity by Albums](results/Artist%20vs%20Spotify%20Popularity%20by%20Albums.png)
The second bar chart compares the Spotify popularity score of different artists and their respective albums. The popularity score is a Spotify metric ranging from 0 to 100 that reflects the recent streaming performance of an artist.

Fig3. Correlation Heatmap of Features

The heatmap provides insight into the pairwise correlation between various digital engagement and streaming metrics across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Spotify, Apple Music, and more.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. Training the Model:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
A RandomForestRegressor model is trained using the training data.

2. Model Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* RÂ² Score

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements for future iterations of the project:

* Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and improve model performance.
* Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
* Feature Importance: Visualize and interpret feature importances to understand which variables contribute most to predictions.
* Model Comparison: Test other regression models (e.g., GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBoost) to compare performance.
